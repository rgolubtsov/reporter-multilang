# Reporter Multilang [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rgolubtsov/reporter-multilang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgolubtsov/reporter-multilang)

**A tool to generate human-readable reports based on data from various sources
<br />with the focus on its implementation using a series of programming languages**

**Note:** Those packages marked as **complete** are considered to be completely implemented and tested. They are ready to use. The **in progress** status means that the appropriate package(s) might be implemented partially or completely, but not yet properly tested:
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Perl 5 (5.10+) implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Python 3 implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Vala implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Genie implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: Go implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_blue_diamond: JavaScript (ES5/Node.js) implementation (complete)
* SQL-PDF :small_orange_diamond: Java implementation (planned/postponed)
